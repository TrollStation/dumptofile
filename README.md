dumptofile
==========

A [Terminator](https://terminator-gtk3.readthedocs.io/) plugin for 1-click dumping of the console contents to a text file (`~/.terminator/$datetime.log`).

One needs to copy the plugin to `/usr/share/terminator/terminatorlib/plugins/` or `~/.config/terminator/plugins/` and enable it under _Preferences_ to make the context-menu (named _DumpToFile_) appear. Dump files are stored under `~/.terminator`.
